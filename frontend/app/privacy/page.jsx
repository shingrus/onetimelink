                <p>
                    {siteHost} is built on a zero-knowledge architecture. Your secrets are encrypted
                    in your browser before they reach our server. We cannot read them. We do not track you.
                    We do not use cookies. We do not run analytics.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Encrypted secret data:</strong> When you create a one-time link, your browser
                        encrypts the secret with AES-256-GCM before sending it to our server. We store only
                        the encrypted ciphertext. The decryption key stays in the URL fragment (<code>#</code>),
                        which is never sent to the server. We cannot decrypt your secrets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Automatic deletion:</strong> Encrypted data is permanently deleted after
                        the link is opened once, or after the expiry period you choose (1–30 days),
                        whichever comes first.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Server logs:</strong> Standard web server logs (IP address, timestamp,
                        URL path, user agent) may be retained for up to 14 days for security and
                        abuse prevention. These logs never contain secret content or decryption keys.

                    encryption locally on your machine before sending data to the server.
                    The same zero-knowledge guarantees apply — the server never sees plaintext or keys.

                    You can run your own instance and control your data entirely. When self-hosted,
                    no data is sent to {siteHost} or any third party.

                    The hosted service at {siteHost} runs on infrastructure located in Europe.
                    All connections are encrypted with TLS. The server stores only encrypted blobs
                    in Redis with automatic expiration.

                    Because {siteHost} collects virtually no data, meaningful changes are unlikely.
