                <h2>Why onetimelink.me?</h2>
                <p>
                    Every day, millions of passwords and secrets get shared through email, Slack, and
                    text messages — channels that store data indefinitely and are vulnerable to breaches.
                    onetimelink.me solves this by creating encrypted, self-destructing links that work exactly once.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We built onetimelink.me because sharing secrets should be as easy as pasting text into a box.
                    No accounts, no setup, no learning curve. Just paste, share, done.
                </p>

                <h2>How it works</h2>
                <ul className="step-list">
                    <li>You type or paste your secret into the message box</li>
                    <li>Your browser encrypts it with AES using a unique generated key</li>
                    <li>Only the encrypted ciphertext is sent to our server</li>
                    <li>You get a one-time link containing the decryption key</li>
                    <li>Your recipient opens the link — their browser decrypts the message</li>
                    <li>The encrypted data is permanently deleted from our server</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div className="about-section">
                <h2>Security by design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>End-to-end encryption: your data is encrypted in the browser before transmission</li>
                    <li>Zero-knowledge: we never have access to your plaintext data or encryption keys</li>
                    <li>One-time access: each link can only be opened once, then the data is destroyed</li>
                    <li>Auto-expiry: even unread messages are automatically deleted after your chosen period</li>
                    <li>Optional passphrase: add a second layer of protection with a shared passphrase</li>
                    <li>No accounts required: no personal data collected, no tracking</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    onetimelink.me is open source. You can inspect the code, verify the encryption implementation,
                    or host your own instance. Transparency is a core part of our security model.
