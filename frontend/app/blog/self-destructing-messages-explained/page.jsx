                <h2>The Concept: Why Messages Should Self-Destruct</h2>
                <p>
                    Most digital messages live forever by default. Emails sit in inboxes for years.
                    Slack messages are searchable indefinitely. Text messages get backed up to cloud
                    services. This persistence creates a massive attack surface — every stored message
                    is a potential leak in a future breach.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Self-destructing messages flip this model. Instead of storing data by default and
                    hoping it stays safe, they <strong>delete data by default</strong> and only make
                    it available for the minimum time needed. This is the principle of data minimization
                    — you cannot leak what you do not store.
                </p>

                <h2>The Three Types of "Disappearing" Messages</h2>
                <p>
                    Not all self-destructing messages work the same way. There are three distinct
                    approaches, and they offer very different levels of actual privacy.
                </p>

                <h3>Type 1: Timer-Based Deletion (Weakest)</h3>
                <p>
                    Apps like Snapchat and Instagram use timer-based deletion. The message displays
                    for a set number of seconds, then the app hides it from the interface. The problem?
                    The data often persists on the server, in backups, in device caches, or in
                    notification logs. Screenshots capture it trivially. This is <strong>UI-level
                    deletion</strong>, not data-level deletion.
                </p>

                <h3>Type 2: Time-to-Live Server Deletion (Better)</h3>
                <p>
                    Services like Signal and Telegram (secret chats) delete messages from their servers
                    after a set period. This is more robust — the data actually gets removed from the
                    server. But the message still exists on both devices until the timer expires, and
                    the sender has no control over what happens on the recipient device.
                </p>

                <h3>Type 3: One-Time Access with Immediate Deletion (Strongest)</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the approach used by one-time secret sharing tools. The message can only
                    be accessed once. The moment the recipient reads it, the server permanently deletes
                    the encrypted data. There is no window of vulnerability, no timer to beat, no
                    second chance. Read once, gone forever.
                </p>

                <h3>The Key Insight: Separation of Key and Data</h3>
                <p>
                    The critical design principle is that the <strong>encryption key never touches the
                    server</strong>. It lives only in the URL fragment (the part after the <code>#</code>
                    symbol), which browsers do not send to servers. The server stores only meaningless
                    ciphertext — even if the server is compromised, the attacker gets encrypted
                    gibberish with no way to decrypt it.
                </p>

                <div className="callout callout-tip">
                    <span className="callout-icon">💡</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why the URL hash matters:</strong> When you visit
                        <code> example.com/v/#secretkey</code>, your browser sends a request for
                        <code> /v/</code> to the server. The <code>#secretkey</code> part
                        stays entirely in the browser. This is a fundamental web standard, not a
                        workaround — it is how URL fragments have always worked.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>What "Zero-Knowledge" Really Means</h2>
                <p>
                    The term gets thrown around a lot, so let us be precise. A zero-knowledge
                    architecture means:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The server never sees the plaintext.</strong> Encryption and decryption happen exclusively in the browser using the Web Crypto API.</li>
                    <li><strong>The server never sees the encryption key.</strong> It is embedded in the URL fragment, which is never transmitted to the server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Even the service operator cannot read your messages.</strong> There is no master key, no admin backdoor, no way to "recover" a lost secret.</li>
                    <li><strong>The source code proves it.</strong> Open-source tools let anyone verify these claims by reading the code.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Limits of Self-Destruction</h2>
                <p>
                    No self-destructing message system is perfect. Here is what even the best
                    implementations cannot prevent:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Screenshots.</strong> Once the recipient sees the message, they can take a screenshot. No technology prevents this.</li>
                    <li><strong>Copy-paste.</strong> The recipient can copy the decrypted text before the page is closed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compromised devices.</strong> If the recipient device has malware or a keylogger, the secret is exposed regardless of encryption.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is why self-destructing messages are a <strong>risk reduction</strong> tool,
                    not an absolute guarantee. They dramatically reduce the window of exposure
                    and eliminate the permanent storage risk, but they cannot control what happens
                    after the message is displayed on a screen.
                </p>

                <div className="callout callout-warning">
                    <span className="callout-icon">⚠️</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Be wary of apps that claim to be "screenshot-proof."</strong> Any app
                        that claims it can prevent screenshots is either misleading you or relies on
                        easily-bypassed device restrictions. The honest approach is to acknowledge
                        this limitation and focus on what can actually be secured: the transmission
                        and storage of data.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>When to Use Self-Destructing Messages</h2>
                <p>
                    Self-destructing messages are ideal for sharing data that is <strong>needed
                    once and should not persist</strong>:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Passwords and login credentials</li>
                    <li>API keys and access tokens</li>
                    <li>Two-factor authentication backup codes</li>
                    <li>SSH keys and certificates</li>
