                    Whether you are hosting guests, running an Airbnb, or onboarding office visitors,
                    sharing WiFi passwords the wrong way can compromise your entire network.

                <h2>Why WiFi Password Security Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Your WiFi password is the gateway to your home or office network. Anyone with the
                    password can connect to your network and potentially access shared files, printers,
                    smart home devices, and see unencrypted traffic from other devices on the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people share WiFi passwords in ways that leave the credential exposed
                    indefinitely: written on a sticky note on the fridge, taped to the router, or
                    sent in a text message that lives forever in the chat history.
                </p>

                <h2>The 5 Safest Ways to Share WiFi Passwords</h2>

                <h3>1. Send a Self-Destructing Link</h3>
                <p>
                    The simplest secure approach: paste your WiFi password into <Link href="/">1time.io</Link>,
                    get an encrypted link, and send it via text or email. The recipient opens it, copies
                    the password, connects to WiFi, and the link self-destructs. No trace left in any
                    message history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is especially useful for Airbnb hosts — send the link in your welcome message
                    and it works once for the guest. After they connect, the password is gone from the
                    conversation.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Use a QR Code (In Person)</h3>
                <p>
                    If the person is physically present, a QR code that auto-connects them to WiFi is
                    the easiest method. Most phones can scan a WiFi QR code and connect without manually
                    typing the password.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The downside: QR codes printed on paper or displayed on a screen are visible to
                    anyone who can see them. Use this for guest networks, not your primary network.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Set Up a Guest Network</h3>
                <p>
                    Most modern routers support guest networks — a separate WiFi network with its own
                    password that isolates guests from your main network. Guests can access the internet
                    but cannot see your devices or shared files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Share the guest network password freely and change it periodically. This way, even
                    if the password leaks, your main network stays protected.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Apple Share Password Feature</h3>
                <p>
                    If both you and the recipient use Apple devices, you can share WiFi passwords
                    automatically via AirDrop-like proximity sharing. The password is transferred
                    encrypted over Bluetooth and never shown on screen.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Tell Them In Person</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes the simplest approach is the best. Say the password out loud, let them
                    type it in, and nothing is stored anywhere. Not practical for remote sharing, but
                    unbeatable for in-person security.
                </p>

                </table>

                <h2>For Airbnb and Rental Hosts</h2>
                <p>
                    If you host guests regularly, the best setup is:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set up a dedicated guest WiFi network on your router.</li>
                    <li>For each new guest, send the password via a one-time link in your check-in message.</li>
                    <li>Change the guest network password between guests (optional but recommended).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This keeps your personal network isolated and ensures no previous guest can access
                    your WiFi after checkout.
                </p>
