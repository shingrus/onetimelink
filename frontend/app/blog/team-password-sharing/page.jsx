                <h2>The Reality of Team Password Sharing</h2>
                <p>
                    In an ideal world, every team would use a password manager with built-in sharing.
                    In reality, most teams — especially small startups, freelance groups, and cross-company
                    collaborations — share passwords the fast way: Slack DMs, email, or text messages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem is not that people are lazy. The problem is that the secure alternatives
                    have traditionally required everyone to install software, create accounts, and learn
                    a new tool. That friction means people default to pasting the password in chat.
                </p>

                <h2>The Zero-Setup Approach: Encrypted One-Time Links</h2>
                <p>
                    The fastest secure way to share a password with a teammate is an encrypted one-time link.
                    Here is the workflow:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Generate a strong password (use the generator below)</li>
                    <li>Click "Share as link" to create an encrypted, self-destructing link</li>
                    <li>Send the link over Slack, email, or any channel</li>
                    <li>The recipient opens the link, copies the password, and it is permanently destroyed</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    No accounts. No installs. No training. The recipient does not even need to know what
                    1time.io is — they just click the link.
                </p>

                <h3>Generate a team password and share it instantly</h3>

                <p>
                    <Link href="/password-generator" className="btn btn-primary">Generate a team password →</Link>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most services require at least 14 characters — try our <Link href="/password-generator-14-characters">14-character password generator</Link> for
                    a quick password that meets most site requirements.
                </p>

                <div className="callout callout-tip">
                    <span className="callout-icon">💡</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Send the link and the context through different channels.
                        Share the one-time link via Slack, and mention which account it is for via email
                        (or vice versa). This way, neither channel contains both pieces of information.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>When This Approach Works Best</h2>
                <p>
                    Encrypted one-time links are the right tool for these situations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Onboarding a new team member</strong> — share staging credentials, API keys, or service passwords on their first day</li>
                    <li><strong>Working with contractors</strong> — they do not have access to your password manager and probably never will</li>
                    <li><strong>Cross-team collaboration</strong> — sharing a credential with someone in a different department or company</li>
                    <li><strong>One-off sharing</strong> — the WiFi password for a conference room, a temporary login, a one-time API token</li>
                    <li><strong>Emergency access</strong> — someone is locked out and needs a password right now</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>When You Should Get a Password Manager Instead</h2>
                <p>
                    One-time links solve the sharing problem, but they do not solve the storage problem.
                    If your team has these needs, it is time to invest in a proper password manager:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Shared credentials that multiple people access daily</strong> — a password manager keeps them synced and current</li>
                    <li><strong>More than 10 shared accounts</strong> — tracking who has access to what becomes unmanageable without a tool</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance requirements</strong> — SOC 2, HIPAA, and similar standards require auditable access controls</li>
                    <li><strong>Team turnover</strong> — when someone leaves, you need to rotate every password they had access to</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Building a Team Password Workflow</h2>
                <p>
                    Even without a password manager, you can establish a secure workflow for your team.
                    Here is a practical protocol:
                </p>

                <h3>Step 1: Generate strong, unique passwords</h3>
                <p>
                    Use a <Link href="/password-generator">password generator</Link> for every shared account.
                    Never let anyone pick a password from their head. Human-chosen passwords are always weaker
                    than generated ones.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 2: Share via encrypted links only</h3>
                <p>
                    Establish a team rule: no passwords in Slack, email, or text. Ever. If someone needs a
                    credential, they get a <Link href="/">one-time link</Link>. This is easy to enforce because
                    it takes the same amount of effort — paste the password, get a link, send the link.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 3: Rotate on departure</h3>
                <p>
                    When someone leaves the team, make a list of every credential they had access to and
                    change them all. This is the most painful part of not having a password manager, but
                    it is non-negotiable. A former team member with active credentials is a security risk.
                </p>

                <h3>Step 4: Document who has access to what</h3>
                <p>
                    Keep a simple spreadsheet (not containing the passwords themselves) that tracks which
                    services exist and who has been given access. When it is time to rotate, you know exactly
                    what to change.
                </p>

                <div className="callout callout-warning">
                    <span className="callout-icon">⚠️</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Never put passwords in a shared spreadsheet.</strong> The access-tracking spreadsheet
                        should only list service names and team member names — never the actual passwords.
                        Passwords should only be shared through encrypted one-time links.
                    </p>
                </div>
