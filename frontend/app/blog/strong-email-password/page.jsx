                    Your email account is the skeleton key to your entire digital life. Anyone who gets in

                <h2>Why Your Email Password Is Your Most Important Password</h2>
                <p>
                    Think about what happens when you forget a password for any online service. You click
                    "forgot password" and get a reset link sent to your email. This means whoever controls
                    your email controls every account attached to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An attacker with access to your email can reset your banking password, your social media
                    accounts, your cloud storage, your work tools — everything. They can also read your
                    private messages, intercept two-factor authentication codes sent via email, and
                    impersonate you to your contacts.

                <h2>What Makes a Good Email Password</h2>
                <p>
                    Your email password needs to meet a higher bar than most account passwords because of
                    how much access it provides. Here are the requirements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>At least 16 characters</strong> — longer provides a larger safety margin against future hardware improvements</li>
                    <li><strong>Mixed character types</strong> — uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and at least some symbols</li>
                    <li><strong>Completely unique</strong> — never used on any other site or service, ever</li>
                    <li><strong>Truly random</strong> — not based on dictionary words, personal info, or patterns</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Generate a Strong Email Password</h2>
                <p>
                    Use the generator below to create a password specifically suited for your email account.
                    It is preset to 16 characters with all character types enabled. Everything runs in your
                    browser — nothing is transmitted anywhere.
                </p>

                <h2>Why Common Email Passwords Fail</h2>
                <p>
                    Every year, security researchers analyze passwords from data breaches. The same patterns
                    appear over and over. Here is what attackers try first:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Dictionary words</strong> — "sunshine", "football", "welcome" — all cracked in under a second</li>
                    <li><strong>Name + numbers</strong> — "michael1985", "sarah123" — trivial for targeted attacks</li>
                    <li><strong>Keyboard patterns</strong> — "qwerty123", "1qaz2wsx" — included in every cracking dictionary</li>
                    <li><strong>Simple substitutions</strong> — "p@ssw0rd", "h3llo" — cracking tools handle these automatically</li>
                    <li><strong>Reused passwords</strong> — if the same password was used on a breached site, it will be tried against your email</li>
                </ol>

                <div className="callout callout-warning">
                    <span className="callout-icon">⚠️</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Check if you have been breached:</strong> Visit haveibeenpwned.com to see if your email
                        address appeared in any known data breaches. If it has, assume any password you used on those
                        services is compromised and change it immediately.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Two-Factor Authentication Is Non-Negotiable</h2>
                <p>
                    A strong password is necessary but not sufficient. You must also enable two-factor
                    authentication (2FA) on your email account. Even if your password is somehow compromised,
                    2FA prevents the attacker from logging in without physical access to your second factor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best 2FA options, in order of security:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Hardware security key</strong> (YubiKey, Google Titan) — phishing-proof, the gold standard</li>
                    <li><strong>Authenticator app</strong> (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password) — strong protection, easier to set up</li>
                    <li><strong>SMS codes</strong> — better than nothing, but vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What About Passphrases?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you need to type your email password frequently (like on your phone), a passphrase
                    might be more practical than a random character string. A passphrase like
                    "Maple-Thunder-Bicycle-Quantum-92" is easier to type than "kX9#mP2$vL4@nQ7!" while
                    providing similar entropy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can <Link href="/passphrase-generator">generate a passphrase here</Link>. For an
                    email password, use at least 5 words with a number included.
                </p>

                <h2>How to Manage Your New Email Password</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Store it in a password manager.</strong> This is the only sane way to handle a random 16-character password. Use 1Password, Bitwarden, or any reputable manager.</li>
                    <li><strong>Write a physical backup.</strong> Store a copy in a safe or locked drawer. If you lose access to your password manager, this is your recovery path.</li>
                    <li><strong>Never share it in plaintext.</strong> If you must share access (joint accounts, emergencies), use an <Link href="/">encrypted one-time link</Link> that self-destructs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not save it in your browser.</strong> Browser password storage is weaker than a dedicated manager and is a common target for malware.</li>
                </ol>

                <div className="callout callout-tip">
                    <span className="callout-icon">💡</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Set up a recovery email.</strong> Make sure your email provider has a recovery
                        email address or phone number configured. If you ever get locked out, this is how
                        you get back in. Protect the recovery email with the same rigor.
