                    Slack DMs, emails, and spreadsheets are the most common ways teams share passwords.
                    They are also the least secure. Here is what to do instead.

                <h2>The Problem: Passwords in Plain Sight</h2>
                <p>
                    It happens dozens of times a day across every company: someone needs access to a shared
                    account, a staging server, or a third-party tool. The fastest solution? Copy the password
                    into Slack, email, or a text message. Quick, easy — and a security disaster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These channels <strong>store messages indefinitely</strong>. That password you sent six
                    months ago? It is still sitting in a Slack channel, searchable by anyone with access.
                    If a single account gets compromised, every password ever shared through that channel
                    is exposed.
                </p>

                <h2>The 5 Worst Ways Teams Share Passwords</h2>
                <p>
                    Before looking at solutions, let us be specific about what <strong>not</strong> to do.
                    These are the methods security auditors flag most often:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Slack or Teams DMs</strong> — Messages are retained by the workspace, often indexed and searchable. Admin users and compliance tools can read DMs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Email</strong> — Stored indefinitely in both sender and recipient inboxes, plus mail servers. Often backed up to archives that persist for years.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shared spreadsheets</strong> — Google Sheets or Excel files titled "passwords.xlsx" shared with the whole team. No access controls, no audit trail.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sticky notes and whiteboards</strong> — The physical equivalent of a plaintext password. Visible to anyone who walks by.</li>
                    <li><strong>SMS or iMessage</strong> — No encryption guarantee between platforms, messages backed up to cloud services, visible in notifications on lock screens.</li>
                </ol>

                <div className="callout callout-warning">
                    <span className="callout-icon">⚠️</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Real-world example:</strong> In 2023, a major tech company suffered a breach after an attacker
                        gained access to a single employee Slack account and found database credentials
                        shared months earlier in a DM that was never deleted.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>The Secure Alternatives</h2>
                <p>
                    There are three solid approaches to sharing passwords securely. The right one depends
                    on your team size, workflow, and security requirements.
                </p>

                <h3>1. Encrypted One-Time Links</h3>
                <p>
                    The simplest approach: paste the password into a tool that generates an encrypted,
                    self-destructing link. Send the link over any channel you want — Slack, email, text.
                    Once the recipient opens it, the password is permanently destroyed.
                </p>

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>Best for:</strong> Teams of any size that need an immediate, no-setup way to share
                    credentials. Works especially well for sharing passwords with external contractors or
                    clients who are not part of your password manager.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Password Managers with Sharing</h3>
                <p>
                    Tools like 1Password, Bitwarden, and Dashlane have built-in sharing features.
                    You can share individual passwords or entire vaults with team members. The data
                    stays encrypted and access can be revoked at any time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Best for:</strong> Established teams that share the same set of credentials regularly.
                    Requires everyone to have an account on the same platform.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Secrets Management Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    For engineering teams, tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Doppler
                    provide programmatic access to credentials. No human ever needs to see or type the
                    password — it is injected directly into the application or environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Best for:</strong> Engineering teams managing infrastructure credentials, API keys,
                    and environment-specific secrets at scale.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In practice, most teams use a combination. A password manager for day-to-day
                    internal credentials, a secrets manager for infrastructure, and one-time links
                    for everything else — especially sharing with people outside your organization.
                </p>

                <h2>Best Practices for Any Method</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Never reuse passwords.</strong> Use a generator to create unique, strong passwords for every account.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rotate credentials regularly.</strong> Especially after someone leaves the team or a contractor finishes a project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication</strong> on every account that supports it. A leaked password is useless without the second factor.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the shortest expiration possible.</strong> If sharing via one-time link, set the auto-destruct timer to match the urgency — do not leave a link active for a week if the recipient will read it in five minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Audit shared credentials quarterly.</strong> Remove access for inactive users and update passwords for shared accounts.</li>
                </ul>

                    <span className="callout-icon">💡</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Quick tip:</strong> When sharing a password via one-time link, send the link and
                        the context (which account it is for) through <strong>different channels</strong>.
                        For example, send the link via email and mention which service it is for over Slack.
                        This way, neither channel contains enough information to be useful on its own.
                    </p>
