                <h2>The API Key Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    API keys are the passwords of the developer world. They grant access to databases,
                    cloud infrastructure, payment systems, and third-party services. A leaked API key
                    can cost real money — from unexpected cloud bills to exposed customer data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet most teams share them the same way they share everything else: copy-paste into
                    a chat message. The key ends up stored permanently in a Slack workspace, an email
                    archive, or a Confluence page that half the company can access.
                </p>

                <div className="callout callout-warning">
                    <span className="callout-icon">⚠️</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Real cost:</strong> Exposed AWS keys are routinely exploited within minutes
                        of being published. Automated bots scan public repositories and paste sites for
                        key patterns. A single leaked key can generate thousands of dollars in unauthorized
                        cloud usage within hours.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h2>Common Mistakes When Sharing API Keys</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Slack or Teams messages</strong> — Stored forever in workspace history, searchable by admins and compliance tools.</li>
                    <li><strong>Git commits</strong> — Even if you delete the key in a later commit, it remains in git history forever unless you rewrite the entire branch.</li>
                    <li><strong>.env files in shared drives</strong> — No access controls, no audit trail, often shared with the entire team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confluence or Notion pages</strong> — Wikis are designed for sharing, not secrets. Anyone with workspace access can find them.</li>
                    <li><strong>GitHub issues or PRs</strong> — Public by default on open source projects. Even on private repos, all collaborators can see them.</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Right Way to Share API Keys</h2>
                <p>
                    There are three tiers of solutions, depending on your team size and infrastructure maturity.
                </p>

                <h3>Tier 1: One-Time Links (Quick and Secure)</h3>
                <p>
                    For ad-hoc sharing — onboarding a new developer, giving a contractor access,
                    sharing a key with a teammate who needs it right now — one-time links are the
                    fastest secure option.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Paste the API key into <Link href="/">onetimelink.me</Link>.</li>
                    <li>Set a short expiration (5-15 minutes is usually plenty).</li>
                    <li>Send the link to your teammate via any channel.</li>
                    <li>The key is destroyed after they view it. Nothing persists.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The key is encrypted in your browser with AES-GCM before being sent to the server.
                    The server never sees the plaintext key. The decryption key exists only in the URL
                    fragment, which browsers never send to servers.
                </p>

                <h3>Tier 2: Secrets Managers (Automated and Scalable)</h3>
                <p>
                    For production infrastructure, use a dedicated secrets manager like HashiCorp Vault,
                    AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or Doppler. These tools:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inject secrets directly into applications at runtime.</li>
                    <li>Provide audit logs of who accessed what and when.</li>
                    <li>Support automatic key rotation.</li>
                    <li>Eliminate the need for humans to ever see or type the key.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Tier 3: Environment-Specific Configuration</h3>
                <p>
                    For development environments, use <code>.env</code> files that are gitignored and
                    never committed. Share the initial values via one-time links, then each developer
                    manages their own local copy.
                </p>

                <h2>Best Practices for API Key Security</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use the principle of least privilege.</strong> Give each key only the permissions it needs. Never share a root or admin key when a scoped key would work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rotate keys regularly.</strong> Set a rotation schedule and stick to it. At minimum, rotate keys when someone leaves the team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use separate keys per environment.</strong> Development, staging, and production should never share the same keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Monitor for leaks.</strong> Use tools like GitGuardian or GitHub secret scanning to detect accidentally committed credentials.</li>
                    <li><strong>Set expiration dates.</strong> Where possible, use short-lived tokens or keys with built-in expiration.</li>
                </ul>

                <div className="callout callout-tip">
                    <span className="callout-icon">💡</span>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Quick rule:</strong> If an API key is important enough to keep secret,
                        it is important enough to share securely. The 10 seconds it takes to create
                        an encrypted link is always worth it.
