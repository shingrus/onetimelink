# [onetimelink.me](https://onetimelink.me) — Self-Hosted One-Time Secret Links with End-to-End Encryption

`onetimelink.me` is an open-source, self-hosted one-time secret sharing app for passwords, API keys, access tokens, private notes, and other sensitive text. It creates encrypted one-time links that self-destruct after the first read, so you can share secrets without leaving them in chat history, email inboxes, or ticketing systems.

If you need a **self-hosted one-time secret link** service with **Docker Compose**, **zero-knowledge encryption**, and a lightweight **Go + Next.js** stack, this repo is built for that use case.

## Why Use onetimelink.me for One-Time Secret Sharing?

- **Self-hosted one-time secret links** — share passwords, API keys, notes, and credentials through links that are designed to be opened once.
- **End-to-end encrypted** — secrets are encrypted in the browser before they leave your device. The decryption key is stored in the URL fragment (`#`), which is never sent to the server.
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** — the server stores only encrypted blobs. Even with full database access, your secrets cannot be read.
- **Self-destructing secret sharing** — each link can only be opened once. After that, the encrypted data is permanently deleted.
- **No signup required** — paste a secret, get a link, share it. No accounts, no tracking.
- **Open source** — the full source code is right here. Audit it yourself or run your own private deployment.
- **Docker Compose ready** — deploy a self-hosted one-time secret service with Redis, nginx, and the Go backend.

## How This One-Time Secret Link App Works

1. You paste a secret into [onetimelink.me](https://onetimelink.me)
2. Your browser encrypts it with AES-GCM and a random key
3. The encrypted blob is sent to the server; the key stays in the URL fragment
4. You share the link — the recipient opens it, the browser decrypts it, and the server deletes the encrypted blob

The encryption key never touches the server. Even if the server is compromised, your secrets remain safe.

## Self-Hosted One-Time Secret Links with Docker Compose

The repo includes a production-ready self-hosted `docker-compose.yml` for encrypted one-time secret sharing. It runs:

- Redis with persistent RDB storage for one-time secret data
- The Go API backend for secret creation and one-time retrieval
- nginx serving the static frontend over plain HTTP and proxying `/api`

Copy-paste quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shingrus/onetimelink.git
cd onetimelink
export DATA_DIR=/srv/onetimelink-data
export APP_HOSTNAME=secrets.example.com
export APP_PORT=8080
mkdir -p "${DATA_DIR}"
docker compose up -d --build
```

This brings the self-hosted stack up on `http://127.0.0.1:${APP_PORT}`.

If you do not need a custom port, you can skip `APP_PORT` and it will default to `8080`.

### Using `.env`

If you prefer a persistent config file instead of shell exports:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set these required values in `.env`:

- `DATA_DIR` — host path for Redis `dump.rdb`
- `APP_HOSTNAME` — public hostname used for one-time links, metadata, and branding, default `onetimelink.me`

Optional values:

- `APP_PORT` — external HTTP port, default `8080`
- `SHOW_BLOG` — blog visibility toggle, default `false` in the compose example for self-hosted deployments

Start everything with one command:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The stack serves plain HTTP on `http://127.0.0.1:${APP_PORT}`. Put your own SSL terminator or reverse proxy in front of it if you want HTTPS for your self-hosted one-time secret link service.

Notes:

- The frontend image is generic. The hostname is injected at container startup, so changing `APP_HOSTNAME` does not require rebuilding the image.
- Blog routes are excluded from the self-hosted build when `SHOW_BLOG=false` and return `404`.
- The default self-hosted path is optimized for private secret sharing rather than the public blog/SEO content used on the hosted site.

## Development

### Requirements

- Go 1.25+
- Redis 8+
- Node.js 25+ and npm

This repo currently builds locally with:

- Go `1.25.5`
- Node `25.2.1`
- npm `11.6.2`
- Redis `8.4.0`

### Backend setup

Start Redis locally and export the backend connection settings:

```bash
export REDISHOST=127.0.0.1:6379
export REDISPASS=
```

Run the backend:

```bash
go run .
```

The app listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

Useful backend commands:

```bash
go build ./...
GOCACHE=/tmp/go-cache go test ./...
make build
```

`make build` now produces both the backend binary in `bin/1time` and the frontend production bundle in `frontend/build`. Install frontend dependencies with `cd frontend && npm install` before using it.

Bootstrap an Ubuntu/Debian VM from this repo checkout after `make build`:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/init_vm.sh
```

The script installs `nginx`, `redis-server`, and `rsync`, creates the `onetimelink` user, copies the built backend into `/opt/onetimelink/bin`, installs the `onetimelink` systemd unit, and starts the `onetimelink` service. If `frontend/build` exists, it also syncs it to `/var/www/onetimelink`.

`init_vm.sh` intentionally does not deploy the deprecated `templates/` flow. Use nginx to serve the React build and proxy only `/api` to the Go app for this deployment mode.

Install the sample nginx site from `configs/nginx/onetimelink.conf`, adjust `server_name`, then run `nginx -t` before reloading nginx.

### Frontend setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Start the frontend dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend runs on Next.js. In development it serves on `http://127.0.0.1:3001` and proxies `/api` to the Go backend on `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, so the Go server must be running first. This keeps frontend requests same-origin in development, matching production behind nginx.

If you need to point the dev proxy somewhere else, set `API_PROXY_TARGET` before `npm run dev`.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` should usually be left unset in local development so the frontend continues to use relative `/api/` requests through the Next.js proxy.

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run frontend tests:

```bash
npm test
```

### Notes

- The frontend has been migrated from Create React App to Next.js with static export for production builds.
- The server-rendered flow under `templates/` is deprecated. It still exists in the codebase, but it is not part of the recommended deployment path.
- Production nginx, Redis, and systemd example configs are in `configs/`.
